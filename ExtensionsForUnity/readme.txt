concave collider
In my test, only the legacy algorithm work well, both for v1.13 and v1.23

v1.13
legacy mode: create many mesh colliders with convex

v1.23
legacy mode: create many box colliders

Note that the model with a concave collider can not be saved as a prefab. 
Even if it is saved, the characters of the result of concave collider calculation will lose.
